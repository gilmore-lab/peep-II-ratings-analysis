# PEEP-II-ratings-analysis

This repository contains files for the PEEP II project.
It focuses on visualizations and analyses of the behavioral ratings.
The [Databrary](http://databrary.org) volume for this study can be found at <https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/339>.
The MATLAB code for presenting audio recordings both in the magnet and outside it, where behavioral ratings were taken, can be found at <https://github.com/gilmore-lab/peep-II>.

- [HTML report](https://gilmore-lab.github.io/peep-II-ratings-analysis/peep-II-acoustics-data-gathering.nb.html) describing workflow for generating tidy data files from MATLAB originals.
- [HTML report](https://https://gilmore-lab.github.io/peep-II-ratings-analysis/peep-II-ratings-data-dictionary.html) with data file specifications and definitions. [Rmd](https://https://gilmore-lab.github.io/peep-II-ratings-analysis/peep-II-ratings-data-dictionary.Rmd)
- [HTML report](https://gilmore-lab.github.io/peep-II-ratings-analysis/peep-II-ratings-visualization-individual.html) showing plots of individual participants. [Rmd](https://github.com/gilmore-lab/peep-II-ratings-analysis/peep-II-ratings-visualization-individual.Rmd)
- [HTML report](https://gilmore-lab.github.io/peep-II-ratings-analysis/peep-II-ratings-acquire-clean.html) showing the acquisition and cleaning steps involved in the child ratings data. [Rmd code](peep-II-ratings-acquire-clean.Rmd)
- Images shown to the participants to make intensity ratings in [HTML](ratings-facial-exemplars.nb.html), [Rmd](ratings-facial-exemplars.Rmd), and [Markdown](ratings-facial-exemplars.md) formats. To regenerate, run `rmarkdown::render("ratings-facial-exemplars.Rmd")`.
- Summary plots of ratings across participants in [HTML](analysis-summary-plots.nb.html), [Rmd](analysis-summary-plots.Rmd), and [Markdown](analysis-summary-plots.md) formats. To regenerate, run `rmarkdown::render("analysis-summary-plots.Rmd")`. Additional image files generated by this script can be found in [`analysis-summary-plots_files/`](analysis-summary-plots_files/).
- Preliminary exploratory work on a cluster analysis in [HTML](cluster-analysis.nb.html), [Rmd](cluster-analysis.Rmd), and [Markdown](cluster-analysis.md) formats. To regenerate, run `rmarkdown::render("cluster-analysis.Rmd")`. Additional images from this script can be found in [`cluster-analysis_files/`](cluster-analysis_files/).
- Files that generate a series of summary analyses on a participant by participant basis that can then be grouped into an HTML presentation:
    - [`render_all.R`](render_all.R): Script that creates individual analyses of all participants' rating data stored in the shared Box folder. Outputs from this script are written to the [`indiv_rpts/`](indiv_rpts/) directory.
    - [`make_rating_slides.R`](make_rating_slides.R): Script creates an HTML formatted set of slides of all outputs in `indiv_rpts/`. The output file is [`peep-II-individual-data-summaries.html`](peep-II-individual-data-summaries.html). To view the presentation in your browser, use [this](https://rawgit.com/gilmore-lab/peep-II-ratings-analysis/master/peep-II-individual-data-summaries.html) link to a version that uses [RawGit](http://rawgit.com). [`peep-II-individual-data-summaries.R`](peep-II-individual-data-summaries.R) is generated as a by-product.
- Scripts to generate CSV rating and demographic data files from their Box and Google sheets sources.
  - [`grab_participant_metadata.R`](grab_participant_metadata.R) gets participant metadata from the Google sheet where this is stored. The Google sheet is only available to selected, authorized users.
  - [`save_merged_ratings_data.R`](save_merged_ratings_data.R) generates and saves a CSV file to `data/csv/` with the ratings data. The raw ratings data are saved on a Box folder that is only accessible to selected, authorized project members.
  - [`merge_peep2_ratings_demo.R`](merge_peep2_ratings_demo.R) merges the demographic and ratings data and saves it to a new file in `data/csv/`.
