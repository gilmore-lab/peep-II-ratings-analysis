# Background

A MATLAB script (https://github.com/gilmore-lab/peep-II/tree/master/peep-II-script) was used to play sounds and record participant responses.

# Ratings files

The script saved a comma-delimited (`.csv`) text file for each participant's testing session.
The ratings file name contains relevant data elements, and so does the file itself.

## Ratings file name format

`rating-` + \<fam_id\> + `-` + \<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM\> + `-run-` + \<run\> + `-order-` + \<order\> + `.csv`.

The \<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM\> is a timestamp of the start of data collection.

## `fam_id`

An integer [1,999] for the target family.
The same identifier is used for the target child and for the target child's mother.

## `nov_id`

An integer [1,999] identifying the novel or control family.

## `run`

A numeric code [1,2] indicating the order in which the two, 32-trial runs were presented.
This should match the order presented to the participant during the fMRI data collection.

## `order`

A numeric code [1,4] indicating which of four orders of scripts was presented to the participant.

## `sound_index`

An integer [1,32] indexing the presentation order of the sound within a given 32-trial run.

## `snd_file`

The local file name/path to the sound file presented for ratings during the indicated trial.
The file name is structured as follows:

"wav/" + \<fam_id\> + "/norm/" + \<fam_id\> or \<nov_id\> + {'ang','hap','neu',sad'} + "/" + {'chk','din','hlp','tlk'} + "/" + {'a','b'} + ".wav"

The \<fam_id\> is the family identifier for this participant.
The specific sound file presented could involve the mother of this participant with \<fam_id\> or the mother of the other, novel or control family with \<nov_id\>.

The target prosody for the sound file could be angry ('ang'), happy ('hap'), non-emotional ('neu' for neutral), or sad ('sad').

The script theme concerned the checkbook ('chk'), dinner ('din'), a request for help ('hlp'), and a request to talk ('tlk').

There were two versions of the scripts within each theme, 'a' and 'b'.

## `happy_rating`

A numeric rating [1,4] in response to the question *'How HAPPY does this sound?'*. 
A rating of one showed the same neutral face as the `sad_rating` and `angry_rating`.
Ratings 2 and greater indicated increasing intensity of perceived happiness.

| 1 | 2  | 3 | 4 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| <img src="img/hap-1.jpg" width=150px/> | <img src="img/hap-2.jpg", width=150px/> | <img src="img/hap-3.jpg", width=150px/> | <img src="img/hap-4.jpg", width=150px/> |

## `angry_rating`

A numeric rating [1,4] in response to the question *'How ANGRY does this sound?'*.
A rating of one showed the same neutral face as the `happy_rating` and `sad_rating`.
Ratings 2 and greater indicated increasing intensity of perceived anger.

| 1 | 2  | 3 | 4 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| <img src="img/ang-1.jpg" width=150px/> | <img src="img/ang-2.jpg", width=150px/> | <img src="img/ang-3.jpg", width=150px/> | <img src="img/ang-4.jpg", width=150px/> |

## `sad_rating`

A numeric rating [1,4] in response to the question: *'How SAD does this sound?'*.
A rating of one showed the same neutral face as the `happy_rating` and `angry_rating`.
Ratings 2 and greater indicated increasing intensity of perceived sadness.

| 1 | 2  | 3 | 4 |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| <img src="img/sad-1.jpg" width=150px/> | <img src="img/sad-2.jpg", width=150px/> | <img src="img/sad-3.jpg", width=150px/> | <img src="img/sad-4.jpg", width=150px/> |

## `how_feel`

A rating [1,5] indicating the participant's answer to the question: *'How does this make you feel?'*.

Images presented were the midscale (intensity = 3) of the happy, sad, and angry ratings used in the study. An additional scared scale was generated for this purpose, and the intensity = 3 image used here.

| Neutral | Happy | Angry | Sad | Scared |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| <img src="img/sad-1.jpg" width=150px/> | <img src="img/hap-3.jpg", width=150px/> | <img src="img/ang-3.jpg", width=150px/> | <img src="img/sad-3.jpg", width=150px/> | <img src="img/sca-3.jpg", width=150px/> |
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

## `know_speaker`

An integer [1,2] made in response to the question *'Do you know who is being spoken to?'*.

| Yes | No |
| :-: | :-: |
| <img src="img/yes-crop.jpg" width=150px/> | <img src="img/no-crop.jpg", width=150px/> |
| 1 | 2 |
